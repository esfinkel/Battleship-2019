- Project was originally posted on our Cornell "GitHub Enterprise" accounts, so the commit history may contain broken references to users.

## Requirements

Instructions for installing the appropriate OCaml version + packages can be found [on the course website](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/install.html). More recent versions will probably work.

Packages used by this game:

* unix
* oUnit
* str
* qcheck
* ANSITerminal
* Yojson

Those packages are a strict subset of the ones installed if you follow the course website's instructions.

## Gameplay

`make play-music` to play the version of the game with music and sound effects (may only work on Macs).

`make play` to play the generic version (has been tested on Linux).
