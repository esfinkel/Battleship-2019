## Gameplay

Instructions for installing the appropriate OCaml version + packages can be found [on the course website](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/install.html).

The version of the game with music and sound effects, run with "make play-music", will likely only work on Macs. The general version, with "make play", has also been tested on Linux.

## If you don't want to install OCaml
"make play-outside" is designed to run the .byte file; this may or may not work on your system.
