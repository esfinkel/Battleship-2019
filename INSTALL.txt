Our battleship game only requires the OPAM packages required 
by the CS 3110 course.

Download src.zip and unzip it using "unzip src.zip".

Go to the directory the zip file is in.
Run "make build".
Run "make play" to run the program and play the game.
Run "make play-music" to play the game with sound effects/music and an animated title screen.
Run "make test" to run our unit tests.
Run "make bisect" and type 'open report/index.html' to view our code coverage percentages.

Note:
We added the option to use the 'default' (normal battleship style) game mode upon running 
make play and also the option to use a customizeable JSON to change things such as board
size, ship names, etc. We included an example of one of these JSON files called "example.json".
To use this file instead of the default battleship game mode, type 'custom_boards/example.json'.
This JSON example is a space mode version of battleship.
