Our battleship game only requires the OPAM packages required 
by the CS 3110 course.

Download src.zip and unzip it using "unzip src.zip".

Go to the directory the zip file is in.
- Run "make build".
- Run "make play" to run the program and play the game.
- Run "make play-music" to play the game with sound effects/music and an 
animated title screen. (We only tested the title screen and 
volume/sound effects on mac, so if make play-music runs into any errors, just 
run make play instead to get all of the same functionality only without sound.
Emoji's may appear differently on windows as well. )
- Run "make test" to run our unit tests.
- Run "make bisect" and type 'open report/index.html' to view our code coverage 
percentages.

Note:
We added the option to use the 'default' (normal battleship style) game mode 
upon running 'make play' (or make play-music) and also the option to use a 
customizeable JSON to change things such as board size, ship names, etc. 
We included an example of one of these JSON files called "example.json". To 
use this file instead of the default battleship game mode, follow gameplay 
instructions and type 'custom_boards/example.json'. This JSON example is an 
example of a space mode version of battleship. (The two types battleship game 
modes we allow are "water" and "space", where every mode that isn't space mode 
is in water mode.)

The format of our JSONS: see the example files in the 'custom_boards' folder.

To use a newly created JSON, just type in the file path when the game prompts 
you to. Otherwise, you can always just use the classic, 'default' battleship 
game with all of the familiar battleship ships and features. (Note that an 
illegal JSON file, such as one with a ship length that exceeds the board size, 
will give a helpful error message telling you how to fix your JSON file.)
